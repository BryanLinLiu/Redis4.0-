/* Background I/O service for Redis.
 * 后台I/O服务
 * This file implements operations that we need to perform in the background.
 * Currently there is only a single operation, that is a background close(2)
 * system call. This is needed as when the process is the last owner of a
 * reference to a file closing it means unlinking it, and the deletion of the
 * file is slow, blocking the server.
 *
 * In the future we'll either continue implementing new things we need or
 * we'll switch to libeio. However there are probably long term uses for this
 * file as we may want to put here Redis specific background tasks (for instance
 * it is not impossible that we'll need a non blocking FLUSHDB/FLUSHALL
 * implementation).
 *
 * DESIGN
 * ------
 *
 * The design is trivial, we have a structure representing a job to perform
 * and a different thread and job queue for every job type.
 * Every thread wait for new jobs in its queue, and process every job
 * sequentially.
 *
 * Jobs of the same type are guaranteed to be processed from the least
 * recently inserted to the most recently inserted (older jobs processed
 * first).
 *
 * Currently there is no way for the creator of the job to be notified about
 * the completion of the operation, this will only be added when/if needed.
 * 定义一个代表job的结构体，以及每种job类型都有一个线程，每个线程有一个job队列
